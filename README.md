# HW03 — LIGO Event Tutorial

This repository contains **Homework 3: From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part II**.
	1.	Packaged code into ligotools/ with a proper pyproject.toml.
	2.	Refactored functions into utils.py (whiten, reqshift, write_wavfile, plot_matched_filter_results).
	3.	Added tests for readligo.py and utils.py using pytest.
	4.	Created a Makefile for environment setup, site build, and cleanup.
	5.	Configured MyST site (myst.yml, _toc.yml) and added a Binder launch button.
	6.	Deployed to GitHub Pages for automatic rebuilds on push.
